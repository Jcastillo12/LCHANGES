        <h3 class="subtitle-internal-page" style="margin-bottom: 50px;margin-top:0px;">Our Philosophy</h3>
        <div class="row">
            <p class="ph-1">We do it the best and we do it with spirit</p>
            <p class="ph-2">When we collaborate, we all win. Especially our customers.</p>
            <p class="ph-3">If we don't have a customer's, we don't have a customer.</p>
            <p class="ph-4">Our work has purpose, and what we do makes a difference.</p>
            <p class="ph-5">We own it. At every level, in every position, we're responsible.</p>
            <p class="ph-6">Growth in our markets begins and ends with you.</p>
            <p class="ph-7">Kindness isn't an option or an opinion. It just is.</p>
            <p class="ph-8">We're considerate of others and encourage their opinions.</p>
            <p class="ph-9">We're accountable, determined and unafraid to take risks.</p>
            <p class="ph-10">We're personable in every interaction. Life is just better that way.</p>
            <p class="ph-11">We're courageous in our innovation, authentic in our actions and transparent in our decisions.</p>
            <p class="ph-12">Passion in all we do makes hard work seem easy.</p>
            <p class="ph-13">Our diversity defines us. Our commonalities connect us.</p>
            <p class="ph-14">Technology excites us, enables us and drives us.</p>
            <p class="ph-15">We're inspired by those sitting next to us, as well as 1,000 miles from us.</p>
            <p class="ph-16">Heart is more than something we have, it's something we share.</p>
